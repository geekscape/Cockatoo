This is the Cockatoo AR.Drone program by Andy Gelme.

README by Chris Samuel based on what I can gather from the source. :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cockatoo proxy connects to an AR.Drone 1 (currently) on the default
IP address of 192.168.1.1 and sends it UDP commands to control it.

When the proxy starts it sets up a TCP port listening for connections on
5600 and accepts commands in plain text.

Currently those commands are:

takeoff
land
forward <repeat>
backward (possibly with a <repeat> argument)

It also opens an X11 window which listens for key presses and translates
them into commands for the drone.  These are:

t - takeoff
l - land
q - land
f - flat trim
e - emergency (the source says "reset")
h - hover (also the space bar)
0-9 - rate
"up" - climb
"shift-up" - forwards
"down" - descend
"shift down" - backwards
"left" - rotate left (yaw left)
"shift left" - roll left
"right" - rotate right (yaw right)
"shift right" - roll right
